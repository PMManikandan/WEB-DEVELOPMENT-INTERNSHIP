                Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real,
                making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality
                headset or helmet. VR allows us to immerse ourselves in video games as if we were one of the characters,
                learn how to perform heart surgery or improve the quality of sports training to maximise performance.
                Although this may seem extremely futuristic, its origins are not as recent as we might think. In fact,
                many people consider that one of the first Virtual Reality devices was called Sensorama, a machine with a 
                built-in seat that played 3D movies, gave off odours and generated vibrations to make the experience as vivid as possible. 
                The invention dates back as far as the mid-1950s. Subsequent technological and software developments over the following years brought 
                with them a progressive evolution both in devices and in interface design.

                Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment 
                in real time. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, 
                AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it.
                Augmented reality is used to either visually change natural environments in some way or to provide 
                additional information to users. The primary benefit of AR is that it manages to blend digital 
                and three-dimensional (3D) components with an individual's perception of the real world. 
                AR has a variety of uses, from helping in decision-making to entertainment.
                AR delivers visual elements, sound and other sensory information to the user through a 
                device like a smartphone or glasses. This information is overlaid onto the device to 
                create an interwoven experience where digital information alters the user's perception 
                of the real world. The overlaid information can be added to an environment or mask part 
                of the natural environment.

            <div class="card-text">
                The major limitation in defining AI as simply “building machines that are intelligent” 
                is that it doesn't actually explain what AI is and what makes a machine intelligent. 
                AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in 
                machine learning and deep learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually 
                every sector of the tech industry.However, various new tests have been proposed recently
                that have been largely well received, including a 2019 research paper entitled 
                “On the Measure of Intelligence.” In the paper, veteran deep learning researcher 
                and Google engineer François Chollet argues that intelligence is the “rate at which a 
                learner turns its experience and priors into new skills at valuable tasks that involve 
                uncertainty and adaptation.” In other words: The most intelligent systems are able to 
                take just a small amount of experience and go on to guess what would be the outcome in 
                many varied situations
